# Node_Farm
A small project written in Javascript with elements of HTML and CSS and implemented through node.js/nodemon.
Node Farm has an overview page with 5 clickable windows. You can pick any to read information about the selected product.
Then you will be able to go back to the overview to pick another product. This simple application was made with the 
purpose of studying backend, node.js and api's. 

To run the application:
1. Make sure you have node.js and .json installed locally. In the terminal run 'npm install' if you do not have them installed. 
2. Run 'node index.js' in the terminal and the application will start running in the background on port 8000.
3. Go to localhost:8000 in web search and you will see the website running!
